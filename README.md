🔍 Terrorism Trends Analysis
This project presents a multi-faceted analysis of global terrorism incidents from 1970 to 2017 using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and UN Population data.

📌 Overview
We built a complete analytical pipeline in R to study the frequency, lethality, and patterns of global terrorist activity. The project covers data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, and predictive forecasting.

🧰 Tools & Techniques
Languages: R

Key Methods:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualizations
2. Statistical Tests (Two-way ANOVA with Bootstrap Resampling)
3. Regression Models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest)
4. Time Series Forecasting (ETS Model)
5. SMOTE-Enhanced Binary Classification (Logistic Regression & Random Forest)

🔍 Key Findings
- Significant surge in terrorism after 2010, with forecasted continued rise.
- Weapon and target types jointly impact attack lethality.
- SMOTE-based classification improved the prediction of rare coordinated attacks.
- PCA + Clustering revealed distinct profiles of terrorist group behavior.
